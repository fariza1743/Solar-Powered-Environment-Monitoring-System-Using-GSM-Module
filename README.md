# Solar-Powered-Environment-Monitoring-System-Using-GSM-Module
In this project, we built a an environmental monitoring system which can be powered by solar energy. The device can measure temperature, humidity and presence of harmful gases by the sensors and send it to the user's mobile as an sms using GSM module. Therefore, wherever 2G netwrok is availbale, this device can be used.
